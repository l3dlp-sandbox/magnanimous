<p>Magnanimous is the simplest and fastest static website generator in the world.</p>

<p>It was created out of frustration with other existing website generators. They all start simple&hellip;
But then, they start adding features until there&rsquo;s so much going on that you need to read a thick book
to fully understand how they work!</p>

<p>All I wanted was a small, fast binary that could just stitch together some files and put them in a directory,
which I could then deploy to my web server without ceremony.</p>

<p>For that to work, a very small set of things need to be available:</p>

<ul>
<li>ability to include files in other files.</li>
<li>ability to customise the contents of included files.</li>
<li>a converter from MD files to HTML.</li>
<li>a small expression language to allow necessary automated content (toc, indexes etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I set out to build exactly that, and I think the result is pretty great!</p>

<p>Please try it and see for yourself what Magnanimous can do!</p>
